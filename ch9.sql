-- 1. Use a window function to add columns showing:
-- The maximum population (max_pop) for each county.
-- The minimum population (min_pop) for each county.
SELECT *,
	MAX(population) OVER(PARTITION by county) AS max_county_pop,
	MIN(population) OVER(PARTITION by county) AS min_county_pop
FROM population;

-- 2. Rank counties from largest to smallest population for each year.
SELECT *,
	RANK() OVER(PARTITION by year ORDER BY population DESC) AS pop_rank
FROM population;

-- 3. Use the unemployment table:
-- Calculate the rolling 12-month average unemployment rate using the unemployment table.
-- Include the current month and the preceding 11 months.
-- Hint: Reference two columns in the ORDER BY argument (county and period).
SELECT *,
	AVG(value) OVER(PARTITION BY county ORDER BY year, period ROWS BETWEEN 11 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS avg_unemployment
FROM unemployment;
